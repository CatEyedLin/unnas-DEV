should this be open source, i'm giving hackers a window to "how to cheat"?
but there's no decated servers, to enforce anti-cheat,
so it have to be spider-web anti cheat, every instance checking each other,
which gives them x-ray, the best might be host based anti cheat,
but then you have to trust the host

anti-cheat idea:
    every card is given a unique, random, ID, when creating the deck
when playing a card, the host checks if that card, with that ID exists
clients, can... check to make...-- no this for clients, and if someone mainy
host plays a card with a miss matched UID and card C&#, calls them out for
cheating


randomly seeded? seed set to everyone
